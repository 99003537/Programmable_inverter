****PROJECT TITLE***** : "Programmable Inverter"




*****PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE*****: "C" (Arduino IDE)




*****DESCRIPTION***** :
  
      In case of electrical vehicles using DC motors as a primary drive for motion, 
      different types of batteries are used. Main concern about batteries is their 
      lifecycle (charging- discharging) and weight. As weight of batteries is directly 
      proportional to power output needed from them, it is necessary to develop some alternative
      or solution on this issue. If we manage to use battery at constant discharging rate, then it
      will result in better performance, long life of battery and high efficiency. Now in case of 
      sudden reverse torque on drive, driver motor takes more current than average current. In this
      case battery supplies the required load current but voltage drops significantly. Here super
      capacitors come into picture, super capacitor is known for its high energy density and high
      discharge rate.  If we used super capacitor in controlled discharged mode in parallel with 
      the battery, then excess load current will be supplied by super capacitor and battery life 
      will increase. As super capacitors have high price as compared to batteries it is not economical
      to use it as direct replacement of battery.
