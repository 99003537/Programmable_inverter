“ Improving battery lifecycle of electric vehicle using programmable converter along with the super-capacitor ”




#	DESCRIPTION

In case of electrical vehicles using DC motors as a primary drive for motion, different types of batteries are used.
Main concern about batteries is their lifecycle (charging- discharging) and weight. As weight of batteries is directly
proportional to power output needed from them, it is necessary to develop some alternative or solution on this issue.
If we manage to use battery at constant discharging rate, then it will result in better performance, long life of battery
and high efficiency. Now in case of sudden reverse torque on drive, driver motor takes more current than average current.
In this case battery supplies the required load current but voltage drops significantly.
Here super capacitors come into picture, super capacitor is known for its high energy density and high discharge rate.
If we used super capacitor in controlled discharged mode in parallel with the battery, then excess load current will be
supplied by super capacitor and battery life will increase. As super capacitors have high price as compared to batteries
it is not economical to use it as direct replacement of battery.
